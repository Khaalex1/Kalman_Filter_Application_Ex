# Kalman_Filter_Application_Ex

This repository contains codes personally developped during the Kalman Filter course delivered by Dr F. COMBLET at ENSTA Bretagne.
The files, entitled TP_1..., TP_2... etc., correspond to the codes answering the questions of the exercices within "ensi_isterobV2.pdf" made by Dr L. JAULIN, also professor at ENSTA Bretagne.
To understand the codes, it can be needed to refer to the corresponding sections and exercices of the pdf.
To recapitulate the topics adressed by each file :
- TP1 : Space representation, rotation matrices, Euler angles
- TP2 : Least Square Estimator
- TP3 : Lidar localization by a Monte-Carlo type method
- TP4 : Introduction to probabilities, Covariance matrices
- TP5 : Linear estimation : Kalman's correction
- TP6 : Complete Kalman filter : correction and prediction 
- TP7 : Kalman's filter application to the localization of a robot
- BE : Assessment made with my colleague and friend H. BONTEMPS on a SLAM problematic (last pages of the pdf)
